###Hashing and Login
In this subunit, I learn how to authorize and authenticate users using Bcrypt. In this simple app, by using WTForms, we created a registration form. Users can register with this form and once then registered they are redirected to view their profile where they can add feedback. While the user is login, the user cannot view the register form again, and also the app has the functionality, unauthorized users cannot view/edit other users' feedback. By doing that, we learned how to keep some data private.
